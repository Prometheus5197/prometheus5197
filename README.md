# 💫 About Me:
With a strong foundation in technical support and quality assurance, I have transitioned into full-stack .NET development. My career began as a Senior Support Executive, where I gained deep, hands-on experience with Windows Server, SQL Server, and IIS for system administration. I routinely used tools like Postman for API testing, performing functional and integration testing to troubleshoot issues, which naturally led me to a dedicated QA role focused on manual and functional testing.<br><br>Building on this, I advanced to my current position as an Associate Software Engineer. Here, I actively develop web applications using the ASP.NET MVC framework, with SQL Server for database management, leveraging my prior operational and testing insights to build robust, high-quality software from the ground up."<br><br>Shorter version for a quick profile:<br>"Starting in senior technical support (Windows Server, SQL Server, IIS, Postman API/QA testing), I developed a strong backend and testing foundation. I have now successfully transitioned to an Associate Software Engineer role, building web applications with ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server, where I apply my end-to-end system perspective to develop reliable software."
